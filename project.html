                <h2 id="About">Food Ordering Platform</h2>
                <p>This project focused on <b>recreating a restaurant order platform</b> where I used <b>MongoDB</b><i> (a noSQL database)</i> to
                    store different unique restaurants and users.</p> 
                    <p> The <b>users have the ability to go onto the site and register/login</b>,
                    this was made possible by using the<b><i> Node.js web framework Express</i></b>.</p>
                    <p> With Express I have
                        set up paths through which the <b>user could request and send data from the server</b>, which was rendered through a <b>template engine</b>.
                         With all of these tools combined I implemented the system where users could order from 3 unique
                    restaurants and view orders of other users.  
                     </p>

                <h2 id="About"> Video Game Bundle Website</h2>
                <p>In this project I have <b>created a store which sells video game bundles to users.</b> All of the info 
                    (users, transaction history, bundles and games) is stored
                    in a <b>SQL database</b> I made using sqlite3. </p>
                    <p>The users have the ability to go onto the site and register/login, which was
                    done using the Node.js web framework Express. With Express I could easily
                    set up paths through which the <b>user could request and send data from the server</b>, which was rendered through a <b>template engine</b>.
                     This allowed me 
                    to implement the store transaction and the ability of users to view their profiles.  </p>
                    <p> Additionally, this project has allowed me to <b>contrast noSQL vs SQL databases</b> and <b>learn more about each of 
                        their strengths and weaknesses</b>.

                <h2 id="About">Papa's Pizzeria Java Game</h2>
                <p>This game revolves around <b>fulfilling different and unique customer pizza orders on a timer.</b> The orders are generated from several <b>templated Linked Lists</b> 
                    that hold the different types of ingredients. The user must then <b>interact with the created GUI</b> to try and fulfill the 
                    customer's order on time! This project was my first OOP project where I tried to implement everything I learned
                    about Java from high school. </p>

                <h2 id="About"> Javascript AddOn</h2>
                <p>I got a request from my graphic designer friend to <b>write a javascript code snippet for his website</b>
                    for a secret effect of his choosing to happen when the user inputs the famous Konami code using the keyboard arrows.</p>
                    <p>This project was not big, but it did gave me <b><i>experience communicating my ideas and solutions with clients who do not 
                    know code</i></b>, and<b><i> explaining how the product they requested works and safely integrating it onto the website</b></i>.
